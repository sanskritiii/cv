    <h1><strong>Head And Tail</strong></h1>
    <p>Sometimes I want to be a saint ,
  Sometimes just drunk and faint ,
  Sometimes the lonely moon make my heart heavy ,
  Sometimes the darksky make my soul smile,
  Sometimes my helpless tear trickle down as I think of you,
  Sometimes it gives me peace that now our story will no one ever knew,
  Sometimes I love the way I detach myself from people,
  Sometimes just scared to love someone to the death and not to get it back,
  Sometimes I'm patient enough to handle your mood waves ,
  Sometimes my anxiety ruin everything that we had ,
  Sometimes I try to find happiness in little things ,
  Sometimes pain attracts me more then any thing ells ,
  Sometime I want to broke apart in the heavy midnight rain laying down on the roof top ,
  Sometimes I'm strong enough to smile as if nothing is wrong at all.</p>
