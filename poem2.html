    <h1><strong>Elegiac Poesy</strong></h1>
    <p>Spending nights in thinking heights
    Verbs, vocabs, verses, and pros
    Reading silently every thing twice
    Willing to make my lyric right
    Spending time with my scoopy writes ,

    Laying down the floor looking to wards the sky
    Staring stars with the glass of wine
    Trying to fly with  wind to vibes ,hills to tides
    Figuring where my world lies ,

    That's all i want to live a life
    But ,
    I'm trapped in the cage called  reality
    They ruined my personality ,
    and attached strings all over my individuality ,
    Crossed all the cruelty ,
    and disseminated me with the cruesial case of insanity ,
    Now the society will define my sanity,
     " your heart says wrong, your  dreams are beyond stop being,
    " exceptional "
    Look at every one and you have to be them
    Stop narrating motion ,emotion fear and pain or ,
    the tear you will only gain " thats what said our mighty socity ,
    Who gave them right to decide my entirety ?
    Sorry society!
    I'll decide the certainity of my uncertain life,
     and i'm not gonna give you any right ,
    I'm gonna make my oceans deep ,
    that will swallow your all fake believes ,
    I'm gonna write my verses again
    , again and again till my last vibe ,
    so the world will remember the story of every pain,
      and the world will say look at that human ,
    who narrate and create all our faith ,
    once they are bound inside the cage,
     now they are found rarely in this stoneage</p>
